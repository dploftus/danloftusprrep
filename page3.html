This number is up 27 percentage points since 2006. Also, 64 percent of employers say graduates with an international background are given greater professional responsibility in the professional world.  Whether it’s the chance to see the world from a different perspective, the networking opportunities available while being surrounded by a brand new community, or the improved communication skills prompted by studying abroad, one thing is for sure – employers see the benefit of the experience, and it affects their hiring decisions. <br><br></p>

Going abroad to a country like Denmark presents a unique opportunity – the chance to become bilingual. The benefits of being bilingual are actually tangible. According to an <a href="https://www.gooverseas.com/blog/real-benefits-of-being-bilingual" target="_blank">MIT economist</a>, bilingual college graduates actually make about two percent more in wages. Also, studies suggest that those who are bilingual have greater memory when given cognitive tests, and this is because those who speak multiple languages use the memory portion of their brain more often. Speaking from experience, being bilingual is a challenging but rewarding experience. Beyond the material benefits, simply being able to speak the native tongue of a country you are exploring is powerful beyond words. It not only helps you get around and fully embrace the culture, but it creates a stronger connection between you, your host family and friends, and the country and community.&nbsp;</p>

It makes communication in groups easier, and it allows you to feel fully involved in activities and conversations. In addition, if you ever would want to live in Denmark permanently, proficiency in Danish is generally required for most jobs and you must have a certain level of Danish skills in order to pass the nation’s <a href="https://actualfluency.com/why-learn-danish/" target="_blank">citizenship exam</a>. Plus, if you think Danish is only applicable to the small nation north of Germany, you would be surprised to find out that it can be helpful in learning other languages too. Both Swedish and Norweigian are quite similar to Danish, and most Danes, Swedes and Norwegians can communicate fairly easily without using a different language.</p>

A classic Danish tongue twister, this phrase which refers to a Danish desert featuring berry pudding and cream, and you’re bound to be asked to say it soon after you arrive. I remember my first day of school when two of my classmates, Victor and Mathias (who would soon become some of my best friends) came up to me and asked me to pronounce the phrase. I could barely hear what they were trying to ask me to say, let alone be able to pronounce the term accurately. Much to their delight, I failed miserably.&nbsp;</div>

Babble magazine ranked the <a href="https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/6-hardest-languages-for-english-speakers-to-learn/" target="_blank">“hardest languages for English speakers to learn,”</a> and Danish came in at number six. As the article describes, Danish is a Germanic language and has a very simple grammar structure which would normally be easy for English speakers to pick up. However, the difference with Danish comes from the pronunciation.  An easy example is how you pronounce “hello” in Danish. The word is spelled “hej,” yet is pronounces like “hie.” Also, the additional letters in the Danish alphabet – æ, å, and ø – can be tricky for those knew to the language.</div>

It took me months to get down the pronunciation of certain letters and phrases, and even when I thought I did, I would be told it was still not quite right. Also, even though Danes love to stump English speakers with their difficult language, the tongue twisters are simply for fun, they are willing to communicate in English. In fact, if you make it a goal in your time in Denmark to learn Danish, you must work at it. Danes are quick to switch to English, so in order to learn you must push yourself to say the words the best you can, and eventually you will master the Danish language, but maybe not rødgrød med fløde.

Throughout the whole application process; the interviews, written materials and paperwork; I was surprisingly not nervous. I was excited about the opportunity before me, and the actual date of by departure felt so far into the future that it was hard to worry. Even when I was driving to the airport with my family I didn’t feel any signs of nerves. The moment when I finally felt butterflies in my stomach came when it was time to go to security and leave my family. I stepped on to the escalator as my family slowly drifted out of sight. It hit me: what am I doing? I had never been away from home alone for more than a couple of days. How will I talk to my family and friends? How am I going to make friends in Denmark? <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had never been out of the country before, and I had to google how to say “hi, how are you?” in Danish as I sat on the plane on the tarmac. All of the possible and normal concerns one would have when embarking on this trip hit me all at once. Yet, in short time, I arrived in Denmark. I quickly made friends, and I maintained a strong relationship with those close to me back home. I definitely didn’t do a perfect job, but I learned as I went on, and I acquired some good tips and ideas to communicate when in this unique circumstance. &nbsp;</p><p></p>

                    <li><strong>TIP 1: Facebook, Facebook, Facebook</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While in Denmark, you better get used to using Facebook. <a href="https://www.nordicom.gu.se/en/latest/news/use-social-media-denmark-2018" target="_blank">Over half</a> of the Danish population uses Facebook on a daily basis. It is not only commonly used, but it is also by far the most widely used. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/738962/social-media-usage-in-denmark-by-platform/" target="_blank">According to a 2017 survey</a>, 84 percent of respondents in Denmark indicated that they use Facebook. Meanwhile, the second highest used platform, Instagram, came in at just 42 percent. From experience, I can say that Facebook is an important part of communication in Denmark. Many of my classmates would text via Facebook Messenger, and events would regularly be posted on the medium. It is best to be familiar with Facebook before going to Denmark to be sure you can keep up with your Danish classmates.</li>
                    <li><strong>TIP #2: What’s Up, WhatsApp? &nbsp;
 &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you’re looking for a platform to be able to text friends and family back home, WhatsApp is a great option. <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/ro/30028016/?lang=en" target="_blank">The app</a> allows you to message from anywhere that you have access to WiFi or mobile data. Also, even if you have a new phone number and SIM card in your phone, you are still able to use your American phone number through the app, so all your contacts will be loaded. I used the app when abroad, and it was great for me to quickly message my parents with questions and text my friends back home to see what they were up to. &nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>TIP #3: Keep me Posted </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Founded in 1997, <em><a href="http://cphpost.dk/" target="_blank">The Copenhagen Post</a></em> is the only English-language newspaper published regularly in Denmark. This weekly newspaper reports on both local and international stories. The online version of the CPH Post is updated regularly with up-to-date news from Denmark in beyond. If you are looking to stay in tune with the latest news from Denmark while also staying in touch with stories global, especially when your Danish-language skill is in its infancy, <em>The Copenhagen Post</em> is a great place to go.


There are plenty of other ways to stay in touch and communicate well as an exchange student.&nbsp;</li>

From August of 2015 through July 2016, I lived in this small country in Scandinavia, once home to the vikings. I lived with three host families in the city of Aarhus, Denmark – which has a history of being one of the <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-in-europe-2016" target="_blank">best places</a> one can visit. While there, I embraced myself in a culture that I quickly fell in love with. I ate traditional Danish foods, like rugbrød to make open faced sandwiches, the small pork meatballs called frikadeller, or kartoffler, potatoes which is a staple in almost every Danish dinner meal. I went to a Danish school where I learned to call my teachers by their first name and prepared to speak up in class during our many class discussions. I played team handball, which is one of the most popular sports in the country, only surpassed by soccer.</p></div>

A high school junior leaving behind his friends and family for an entire year to live in a country most know very little about and couldn’t pick out on a map? For a while, I understood this sentiment – and by no means is it an easy process. I missed my family and friends back home and I missed the life that I had built up through my childhood. It is difficult to start from scratch, especially in a place where <a href="https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/6-hardest-languages-for-english-speakers-to-learn/" target="_blank">speaking their language’s words</a> can be a struggle.

The event featured four guest panelists that included two Syracuse University students, Dr. Gray, a Syracuse faculty member in the religion department, and Orlando Bailey who works as community engagement manager for a nonprofit called Eastside Community Network in Detroit, Michigan. The conversation focused on being an open dialog and it ranged a variety of topics, but the center of it all was the idea of broaching topics that may make people uncomfortable. Things that were brought up were meant to express general feelings and present blunt truths to foster a productive and meaningful discussion.</p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8">&nbsp; &nbsp;This was the most profound and impactful Newhouse event I have attended in my time here. The conversation varied from personal experiences with diversity and inclusion to the topic of change and the steps people on campus can take to have meaningful change. A thread throughout was the idea that there is a lack of space “at the table” for minorities, both in public and on campus, to be part of the greater narrative and dialogue. The discussion also got into the current political and social climate in which we live. These were impactful discussions both as a student at Syracuse University and as someone who is entering the communications field.</div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8">&nbsp; &nbsp;The discussion that I really connected with was when the group talked about how media impacts the way we identify and label others. Orlando Bailey said that messages about people of different identities are “fed to the mainstream public.” This impacts us in that when we meet someone or come across anyone with a different identity in the real world, we are quick to associate that person with the identity we are told through the media. This is extremely powerful in how the media shapes our perception of others, and it helps perpetuate the harmful stereotypes and regurgitated identities that continue inequalities. As communicators, we must be aware of this, and not just be inclusive, but make fundamental and concrete changes in order to reshape perspectives. Dr. Gray talked about how we see ethnically diverse people on campus promotional content, but that does not change the treatment of ethnic minorities on campus. This disconnect is troubling and means we are not close to the equality those pamphlets are trying to express.</div>

Doing what is easy or what appears to be inclusive on the surface probably is not, and it most likely will just further the disconnect between what is communicated and what is reality. Part of this is, of course, surrounding myself with diverse perspectives to understand the power in numbers and to question everything.  Finally, as a Syracuse student, I have the privilege and resources on this campus to have the conversation and make action to create inclusion that is real on this campus. I should not wait for that change to come to me. I can take it on as myself, and better myself, my content and my community all the same.<div><br></div><div><br></div></div>

It began by playing the documentary “Chi-Town,” and was followed by a Q&amp;A with the Director, executive producer, and two representatives from SNUG, which is an organization in Syracuse which works to reduce violence in the city. These panelists discussed the film after its conclusion and took questions from the audience on the topic of gun violence and poverty in Syracuse and the overall making of the film. The documentary told the story of Wisconsin-Green Bay star point guard Keifer Sykes, and his journey from his senior year of college all the way through to playing professionally in Korea. Along the way, we came to understand the circumstance of living in the dangerous neighborhood where his family lived in Chicago. The one representative from SNUG said how he felt the film was very well done and told an important story, but he could also tell the same story of hundreds of young men in the Syracuse area.</div>

Questions for the panel began to come in regarding what SU students and the University as a whole could do to help the underprivileged neighborhoods in Syracuse. Suggestions included simply going to these areas and spending more time with the people and communities to begin to lessen the divide between the “castle on the hill” and the city of Syracuse. Also, the director of the film, Nick Budabin, said that students and faculty must understand and recognize that there is a problem with gun violence right here in Syracuse, and when we are thinking of the problem on a national scale, we must also consider what is happening right here in our own community.<br></p>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8">&nbsp; &nbsp;After a long and valuable discussion on the topic of gun violence, the question of actually making the film began to come up. The most valuable piece from the discussion to me, in terms of public relations, came during the conversation about trust. The filmmakers discussed how they worked with Sykes, the subject of the film, for a total of seven years – as they had to follow him from his senior year of high school, all the way through to college graduation and professional basketball. One member of the audience asked the director how he built up such great trust with his subject. Budabin said the key was being there for Sykes even when they didn’t need anything or to film. He said he would visit him even during non-filming periods just to check in, and they always came back, so they knew they could trust him and his small crew. As PR practitioners, trust with our clients and our publics is paramount. We must understand that both must trust us for the relationship to grow and build. Sometimes, that takes sacrifices beyond your end goal to make happen, just like Budabin with Sykes.  I thought this was an important lesson not just for documentary filmmaking, but public relations as well.</div>

That alone was a valuable lesson from this Newhouse event. As for trust, I learned about it from the perspective of a filmmaker, but understood and saw the comparisons to public relations as well.</div>
