If you don’t know, you’re not alone, but if you’re planning to study in Denmark, you better learn soon. A classic Danish tongue twister, this phrase which refers to a Danish desert featuring berry pudding and cream, and you’re bound to be asked to say it soon after you arrive. I remember my first day of school when two of my classmates, Victor and Mathias (who would soon become some of my best friends) came up to me and asked me to pronounce the phrase. I could barely hear what they were trying to ask me to say, let alone be able to pronounce the term accurately. Much to their delight, I failed miserably.&nbsp;</div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8">&nbsp; &nbsp;Failure by native English speakers to be able to pick up the Danish language is by no means uncommon. Babble magazine ranked the “hardest languages for English speakers to learn,” and Danish came in at number six. As the article describes, Danish is a Germanic language and has a very simple grammar structure which would normally be easy for English speakers to pick up. However, the difference with Danish comes from the pronunciation.  An easy example is how you pronounce “hello” in Danish. The word is spelled “hej,” yet is pronounces like “hie.” Also, the additional letters in the Danish alphabet – æ, å, and ø – can be tricky for those knew to the language.</div>

The Danish people are some of the best at speaking English as a second language in the world. According to a 2016 English Proficiency Index, Danes are the third best non-native English speakers in the world. Also, as of 2017, 4.8 million Danes, or 91% of their population, speak English as a second language. Their access to content in English and the fact that they are taught to speak English at a young age both contribute to this high-level of language proficiency. &nbsp;</p>

All of my host families were easily able to speak in English, and even the older members of the family could speak with me at a conversational level. If communication level is a concern when deciding whether or not to study abroad, don’t let the Danish tongue deter you from visiting.&nbsp;</p>

It took me months to get down the pronunciation of certain letters and phrases, and even when I thought I did, I would be told it was still not quite right. Also, even though Danes love to stump English speakers with their difficult language, the tongue twisters are simply for fun, they are willing to communicate in English. In fact, if you make it a goal in your time in Denmark to learn Danish, you must work at it. Danes are quick to switch to English, so in order to learn you must push yourself to say the words the best you can, and eventually you will master the Danish language, but maybe not rødgrød med fløde.

Throughout the whole application process; the interviews, written materials and paperwork; I was surprisingly not nervous. I was excited about the opportunity before me, and the actual date of by departure felt so far into the future that it was hard to worry. Even when I was driving to the airport with my family I didn’t feel any signs of nerves. The moment when I finally felt butterflies in my stomach came when it was time to go to security and leave my family. I stepped on to the escalator as my family slowly drifted out of sight. It hit me: what am I doing? I had never been away from home alone for more than a couple of days. How will I talk to my family and friends? How am I going to make friends in Denmark? <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had never been out of the country before, and I had to google how to say “hi, how are you?” in Danish as I sat on the plane on the tarmac. All of the possible and normal concerns one would have when embarking on this trip hit me all at once. Yet, in short time, I arrived in Denmark. I quickly made friends, and I maintained a strong relationship with those close to me back home. I definitely didn’t do a perfect job, but I learned as I went on, and I acquired some good tips and ideas to communicate when in this unique circumstance. &nbsp;</p><p></p>

Over half of the Danish population uses Facebook on a daily basis. It is not only commonly used, but it is also by far the most widely used. According to a 2017 survey, 84 percent of respondents in Denmark indicated that they use Facebook. Meanwhile, the second highest used platform, Instagram, came in at just 42 percent. From experience, I can say that Facebook is an important part of communication in Denmark. Many of my classmates would text via Facebook Messenger, and events would regularly be posted on the medium. It is best to be familiar with Facebook before going to Denmark to be sure you can keep up with your Danish classmates.</li>
                    <li><strong>TIP #2: What’s Up, WhatsApp? &nbsp;
 &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you’re looking for a platform to be able to text friends and family back home, WhatsApp is a great option. The app allows you to message from anywhere that you have access to WiFi or mobile data. Also, even if you have a new phone number and SIM card in your phone, you are still able to use your American phone number through the app, so all your contacts will be loaded. I used the app when abroad, and it was great for me to quickly message my parents with questions and text my friends back home to see what they were up to. &nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>TIP #3: Keep me Posted </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Founded in 1997, The Copenhagen Post is the only English-language newspaper published regularly in Denmark. This weekly newspaper reports on both local and international stories. The online version of the CPH Post is updated regularly with up-to-date news from Denmark in beyond. If you are looking to stay in tune with the latest news from Denmark while also staying in touch with stories global, especially when your Danish-language skill is in its infancy, The Copenhagen Post is a great place to go.


There are plenty of other ways to stay in touch and communicate well as an exchange student.&nbsp;</li>

From August of 2015 through July 2016, I lived in this small country in Scandinavia, once home to the vikings. I lived with three host families in the city of Aarhus, Denmark – which has a history of being one of the best places one can visit. While there, I embraced myself in a culture that I quickly fell in love with. I ate traditional Danish foods, like rugbrød to make open faced sandwiches, the small pork meatballs called frikadeller, or kartoffler, potatoes which is a staple in almost every Danish dinner meal. I went to a Danish school where I learned to call my teachers by their first name and prepared to speak up in class during our many class discussions. I played team handball, which is one of the most popular sports in the country, only surpassed by soccer.</p></div>

We danced around the Christmas tree and sang songs, ate herring (which I probably could have gone without), and searched for the almond in the dessert rice pudding to try to win an extra gift. I made friends and second families that will last me a lifetime. I truly had an experience I will never forget, and now Denmark will forever be part of who I am. I proudly bring my Danish flag, the off-centered white cross on a red background, with me wherever I live.</p><p></p><p></p>

The organization helps sponsor 15-19 year olds on a cultural exchange by connecting young adults and families from around the world. This process brings hundreds of people from around the globe together to share in an experience in a country both are not familiar with. Also, volunteer families welcome these students and allow them to experience their culture first-hand by making them feel at home. I shared in these experience during my time as a student in the program, and I am forever grateful to Rotary for the lessons I learned in their unique opportunity.</p>

I will talk about how large a role communication plays in living by oneself in a foreign country. I will share cultural differences and unique aspects that make Denmark the great place that it is. Through my experiences, and the stories of others, I hope to shed some light on what it was like to be a Rotary Youth Exchange Student, and maybe, persuade others to take the same journey. I will share the highs and lows, and everything I learned in between in the hopes of inspiring other adventure seekers to visit the land of the vikings.</p><div><br></div><div>Skål!</div><p></p></div>
